			"Strategic Information & Communications Group (SIC Group) advises businesses, governments and international organizations on strategic and public policy issues through a unique blend of geo-political expertise and in-country data collection and analysis."
		],
		body:[
				"Our in-country researchers and policy experts garner critical information intelligence regarding the make-up, interests and aspirations of the population and assess the trends and impacts across all layers of the society.  This assessment is essential to effective governmental planning and business/market strategies, particularly in emerging and frontier markets where public policies are in the initial stage of development, international alliances are still in formation, essential infrastructure is lacking and accurate information about the population is sparse.",
				"As international events demand more focus directly on these markets, political, economic, cultural and social research is an essential tool in strengthening the governance capabilities and policy- resolution outcomes that our principals have successfully achieved for our clients for more than 20 years.",
				"The SIC Group team is comprised of highly accomplished experts with years of first-hand field experience in all our practice areas. Our staff has served as advisors and consultants to some of the highest-level domestic and international government officials as well as representatives of Fortune 100 and multinational companies."
